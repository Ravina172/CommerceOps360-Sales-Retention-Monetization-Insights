## 🧭 Project Background

This project was developed as a **real-world business simulation** to demonstrate my readiness for the **Senior Associate - Business Management Track**. I assumed the responsibilities of a strategy and operations analyst working at an e-commerce company (Shopify) to build a Power BI dashboard that solves real challenges in user growth, monetization, and category strategy.

The goal was to reflect the kind of cross-functional thinking, analytical depth, and business impact expected in a Senior Associate role — as seen in dynamic companies.

## 🎯 Business Challenge (Simulated)

In this simulated scenario, Shopify faced challenges in:
- Understanding which product categories drive sustainable growth
- Improving retention and customer loyalty metrics
- Identifying regional growth pockets and underserved demand
- Aligning payment behaviors with monetization strategies

To solve this, I created a dashboard that acts as a **decision-support tool** for leaders across category management, user growth, and fulfillment.

## 💼 Strategic Business Outcomes (Role-Simulated)

| Business Vertical         | Strategic Impact Simulated                                                              |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Category Management**   | Analyzed top-performing products by sales and orders to recommend SKU-level strategies   |
| **User Growth**           | Segmented repeat vs single-order customers to inform re-engagement plans                |
| **Fulfillment & Experience** | Mapped hourly and city-wise activity to optimize delivery and support scheduling   |
| **Business Development**  | Identified expansion-ready regions based on customer density and frequency               |
| **Monetization**          | Evaluated AOV and LTV across segments to design upselling and payment-linked offers     |

## 📌 KPIs Tracked

- **Net Sales** (pre-tax revenue)
- **Average Order Value (AOV)**
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
- **Repeat Customer Rate**
- **Purchase Frequency**
- **Top Product Types by Revenue**
- **City- and Province-Level Sales**

## 🔍 Key Business Insights (Based on Mock Data)

1. **Repeat customers drove 60%+ of revenue**, indicating retention is the biggest revenue lever.
2. **Evening sales spikes (6–9 PM)** suggest optimal campaign and delivery windows.
3. **Product Category B** had highest LTV and repeat frequency — strong promotional candidate.
4. **UPI dominated in usage**, but credit card customers had higher AOV — scope for premium targeting.
5. **Five cities drove nearly half the revenue**, while smaller cities showed potential with low competition.
